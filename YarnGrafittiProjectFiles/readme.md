## Working together to make a nice landscape to display out to the world

While the novel coronavirus has put a damper on how this project could have turned out, it was made nontheless.
The sky was done with a simple single crochet stitch and the grass was done with a double stitch. The mountains in the back were done with a single stitch but were folded to create their shape.
This folding technique was done to increase the texture of the mountains and make them stand out more from the night sky and the grassy fields. If I were to do the mountains all over again, I would have made them a bit wider and a bit longer as I didn't have enough material in the mountains to do what I wanted with them.
