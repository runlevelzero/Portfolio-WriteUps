# Running with the Stitches

For this project, I initially wanted to make a geometric pattern similar to what you would see as infill in 3d printed parts along a perspective cube, but in the process of completing one face, I inadvertently made an arrow crossing over two colors. I liked this design a lot more than the simple geometric pattern that would have emerged had I gone through with my plans initially. So I decided to make another arrow in a color that would contrast not only the first arrow, but also the background. This second arrow crosses over the first and goes in a direction perpendicular to the first.
