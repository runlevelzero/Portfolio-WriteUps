## Taking time to breathe and make some unique pieces of string in the process

A lot is happening nowadays and it is absolutely necessary to take some time to clear your mind of the nonstop news cycle and all of the interesting emotions associated with accepting the social resposibility of social distancing and self quarantining. While it may be frustrating to be stuck in the house for all of this time. We are doing it for a reason, and it is important that we remember that as we continue to fight this battle with the novel coronavirus. And while here in Texas, the statewide mandate for businesses and individuals has been lifted, we are not out of this yet. Please be resposible and still only go out when you need to. we are in this together, no one else needs to die because we couldn't stay indoors.

That got a bit intense... But please find something to do indoors. I've been bored during this and it is the worst. Stay active both physically and mentally. And please, take some time away from all of this to relax.
