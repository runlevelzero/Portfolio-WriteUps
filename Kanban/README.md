This project was my first experience with a lot of key web technologies and software development tools. It was done as a part of an internship at [Inventive](https://inventive.io) during the summer of 2019. During the internship, we were tasked [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) with a similar featureset to [Trello](https://trello.com). We were given about six weeks and an icebox full of features to implement to create our app. As a team, we had basic experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript going into it, but had to learn how to use technologies that will make the task of making a website with some of the features of Trello much easier, so as a team, we spent about a week and a half getting up to speed on how scrum works as well as React.js, node, mongodb, express, and CircleCI and started working on the backlog assigned to us by our scrummaster.
