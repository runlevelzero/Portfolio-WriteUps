This project was my first experience with a lot of key web technologies and software development tools. I worked in a scrum team as part of an internship at [Inventive](https://inventive.io) during the summer of 2019. In this project, we were tasked with creating a [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) with a similar featureset to [Trello](https://trello.com). Over the course of 6 weeks, we were tasked with implementing many features found in trello that were pre-seeded to us in a backlog.

The first week or so, we focused on learning the various technologies that we were to use for this project. Before this project, I had no experience with NodeJS and React so it was an interesting experience to get to know these new modern web technologies. Up until that point, the only experience I really had with web development was with pure HTML, CSS, JS and some JQuery. I didn't have any experience with any backend scripting and programming languages. I went through a couple of tutorials mainly focusing on the frontend with some React tutorials and getting to do some quick sample projects that showed some of the absolute power of React over vanilla web frontend languages.

I was also given my first experience with some continuous integration technologies with basic CircleCI and we deployed to netlify. After tackling how we deployed our front end, we were able to really get underway. Over the course of the 6 weeks, we were able to implement many of the front end features including multiple boards, completely custom CSS and the ability to swap the CSS to a different theme, customizable swimlanes and drag and drop re-arrangement for the cards and swimlanes. Backend development for this project was developed towards the end of this project and was not able to get integrated with the main frontend, but we worked on getting mongodb connected to express and logging in with passport.
